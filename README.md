# ICP-Visual-Recording-Simulation
Image recording is an image processing technique used in some part of our lives. This technique is used in very important areas and provides a lot of help to our vital unit. Especially due to their effectiveness in medicine, satellite tracking and military defense industry, conducting a lot of studies is always aimed at designing a system with better growth with new explosions. The 3D system of point clouds is widely used in autonomous vehicles, and a good result can be achieved by operating ICP on images and point shifts while scanning.

Within the scope of the project, two simulations, 2D and 3D, were carried out.
